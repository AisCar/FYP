##Busy Beavers and Genetic Algorithms
The aim of the busy beaver game is to find the n-state Turing machine,
for any natural number n, which writes the highest number of values to a
tape. The number of values written is called the busy beaver function Σ(n).
Although this is a simple concept, the number of n-state Turing machines
grows rapidly as n increases, so it is difficult to compare all of them.

This code is for a research project that will investigate whether the use of genetic algorithms
to generate busy beavers with high Σ(n) is a good alternative to
generating and examining all n-state Turing machines.

##Code in this Repository
The code includes:
- a genetic algorithm implementation
- a Turing machine emulator
- code that generates an intial population of Turing machines for the genetic algorithm
- tests
